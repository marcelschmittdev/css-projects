This is a monorepo containing all my CSS projects. These are usually projects where I take a design I find on the Internet (e.g. Dribbble, Figma Community, UXCrush, etc.) and implement them using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Occasionally, I will also use some frameworks or other tools like Sass.

You should be able to start most of them using a simple web server. The most convenient option is the Live Server extension for VS Code.
